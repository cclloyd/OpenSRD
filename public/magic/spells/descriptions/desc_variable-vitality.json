You imbue the area with shimmering multicolored pure positive chaos energy. Creatures in the area of effect have their vitality to fluctuate wildly.  Positive chaos energy has a random chance of turning into negative energy at any given moment of reality.  If your alignment is evil, this spell functions as negative chaos energy, and acts oppositely accordingly.

Each round, roll a d20 for each creature in the area of effect.  If it is 5 or less, the creature is harmed instead of healed. Roll a d% to determine the amount of damage healed/dealt. If they are damaged, they take half the amount of the d%. If you roll a 100, continue rolling a d% and adding it to the total until you roll 99 or less.  Do all rolls before you do any math.

This cannot bring a creature below 1 hitpoint, or above 75% of their max health. If the creature would be damaged by this spell, they get a will save to half the damage (Â¼ total damage).
